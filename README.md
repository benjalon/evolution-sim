## Using Git
Once you are added as a developer of the project you can start editing the repo code. It is recommended that you use git desktop to manage your contributions. 

To contribute properly you need to:
- Make a new branch whenever you want to change something. 
- Commit on this branch often. It is better practice to commit frequently. 
- Once you have solved an issue, reference it in the commit or pull requests. Put a message in the commit and then reference an issue by using the keyword Fix followed by the repo address and the issue number. e.g. `Fixed roaming bug. Fix benjalon/evolution-sim#14`
- Referencing the issues in this way allows them to be automatically closed, saving time for later and showing the exact bit of code that fixed the problem.
